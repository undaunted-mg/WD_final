To Use this project you need 4 windows open.

First you need to make a folder that will hold your database items. You can do this easily in terminal by using the sudo mkdir -p /data/db command.

Then you need to give your computer permissions to use these files so in terminal use the command:
sudo chown -R 'username' /data/db 

After that, you need to open 4 terminal windows in order to run this program.

1.Open terminal and run this command:
~/desktop/WD_final/mongodb/bin/mongod 

This runs the mongodb database

2. Open another window:
~/desktop/WD_final/mongodb/bin/mongo --host 127.0.0.1:27017

This opens ups the mongo shell so we can see what's happening when messages in the forum go out.

3.Open another window
cd ~/desktop/WD_final/MEANStack2018/front-end

Then run this command:
gulp serve

This opens up the webpage so we can see the front-end part of the webpage.

4. Open another window!
cd ~/desktop/WD_final/MEANStack2018/back-end

Then run this command:
node server.js

This allows the back end part of the data to work.

If you wish to clear out the forum, go back to mongo shell and type db.dropDatabase();

And that's it!
